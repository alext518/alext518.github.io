==================

My final project for WEB 115

This is a website designed to be optimal for mobile devices. 

I am accomodating to this by making a simple menu that can easily be access to move throughout the website. It starts with the 3 pages that will be included in the website. And as you click on each page there will be a link to the navagation that can be clicked anywhere on the page, using "float: fixed".
