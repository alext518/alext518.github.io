While you are lying out on the beaches you can always plan ahead for a variety of events, some include minor league baseball games, water parks, museums, or a dinner theatre with world class entertainers. Amusement parks include magic shows, adrenaline laden speed rides, children's rides and some of them are right on the ocean for great views of the strand. </p>
<h2>Board Walk</h2>
<p>The Myrtle Beach area's new 1.2 mile-long Oceanfront Boardwalk and Promenade traverses through the sand from the 14th Avenue to 2nd Avenue Piers in Myrtle Beach.  Throughout the summer, the popular Myrtle Beach Boardwalk is home to festivals and events, including Ocean Boulevard's Hot Summer Nights located at Plyler Park in the heart of the downtown area. Always a family favorite, the boardwalk provides oceanfront views of the pristine beach line, numerous shops and restaurants along its path, and is divided into three different sections:
<ul>
<li>The northernmost portion winds down from the 14th Avenue North Pier to Plyler Park.</li>
<li>The mid-section is located from Plyler Park to the former Pavilion Amusement Park site at 8th Avenue North and encompasses more of a carnival-like atmosphere with oceanfront dining and businesses.</li>
<li>The southernmost end of the boardwalk leading up to the 2nd Avenue pier has a meandering oceanfront park.</li>
</ul>
The construction of the impressive boardwalk was complete in May 2010. Did you know the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk took nine months and nearly $6.5 million to build? It is comprised of nearly 800,000 feet of lumber, and builders used around 300,000 nails, 555,000 screws and 10,000 bolts to complete the project!

  Get ready to feel the incredible speed of an over 100 foot waterslide drop off and splashdown, then get up and do it again. For deep relaxation enjoy a 425 foot long lazy river with several refreshing waterfalls. Each of our waterparks is specifically designed for family fun with a focus on the kids with splash pools, waterfalls, myriads of slides, which is a great way to teach children to swim and to refine water skills. Get on a wild wavy ride on one of the many water flumes and zoom in circles down long slides with perfect views of the Myrtle Beach oceanfront. Race your friends down the gigantic speed waterslides in a head first sled mat style competition over and over again.</p>
